#
# WHY A HOOK AND NOT A CONSTRAINT IN THE SKILL
# The skill says "You MUST NOT edit terraform/, cdk/, app/common/ ...". That is a request
# to a model, and a model under pressure to make a test pass will edit a framework file
# and explain why it was justified. An exit code is not negotiable.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
# It is a DEV-TIME GUARD, not a security boundary. It sees only the write tools, so an
# agent determined to route around it can use `execute_bash` with a heredoc. That is
# deliberate: closing that path means policing every shell command, which breaks the
# build, the formatters and the generators. The backstop is
# `orchestrator/tests/test_edit_boundary.py`, which inspects the working tree rather than
# the call — so if this hook is bypassed or disabled, the gates still catch it.
#
# FAILS OPEN, LOUDLY. If the payload cannot be parsed, this warns and allows, because the
# alternative is an agent that cannot write anything at all the first time Kiro changes a
# field name. The unparsed payload is appended to /tmp/agentexpress-hook-unparsed.jsonl so
# the key can be corrected rather than guessed at twice.

guard-edit-boundary: BLOCKED a write to a framework file.

  $REL

A workflow implementation touches only these four places:

  orchestrator/app/workflow.json     agents, topology, tools, gates, RBAC, UI strings
  orchestrator/app/subagents/<id>/   one folder per agent
  orchestrator/app/tools/<name>/     a tool's handler.py or openapi.json
  orchestrator/kb_docs/<corpus>/     your documents

Everything else — the IaC, the Gateway targets, the Cedar policies, the guardrail, the
IAM, the BFF and the UI — is GENERATED from those four. Editing it directly is either
overwritten on the next generate or left disagreeing with the config that produced its
neighbours.

If a framework file genuinely has to change, that is a framework change rather than a
workflow one: make it deliberately, on its own, and say so. Disable this hook in
.kiro/hooks/guard-edit-boundary.json while you do.
