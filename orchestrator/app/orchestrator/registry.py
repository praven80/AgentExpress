"""Agent registry: builds the map of agent_id -> Agent instance from workflow.json.

An agent's `runtime` decides its implementation:
  * runtime "main"      -> import app.subagents.<module> and run it in-process
                           (a LangGraph node inside the orchestrator runtime).
  * runtime "dedicated" -> AgentCoreRuntimeAgent: the orchestrator invokes that
                           agent's OWN AgentCore Runtime (its own container),
                           passing/returning the same data an in-process agent
                           would. The dedicated runtime itself runs the real
                           module via build_agent_module() below.
  * runtime "a2a"       -> A2AAgent: the step is run by an agent THIS WORKFLOW DOES
                           NOT OWN, reached over the Agent2Agent protocol at its
                           Agent Card URL. No module under app/subagents/, because
                           the code is somebody else's.
All three expose the same Agent interface, so the graph wiring is identical.

The first two are placements of OUR code; the third is a trust boundary. That is why
`a2a` is a `runtime` value and not a `tool`: a tool returns data for one of our
agents to reason over, whereas this replaces the agent.

#: The `type` a `tools` entry may declare. DELIBERATELY CLOSED, and it is the right
#: boundary rather than an oversight: each value is a different kind of Gateway target
#: with different infrastructure behind it — a Knowledge Base on S3 Vectors, a managed
#: connector, a Streamable HTTP MCP target, an OpenAPI target with a schema in S3, a
#: Lambda target with an inline schema. A sixth kind needs infrastructure that config
#: cannot describe, so it needs framework code by definition.
#:
#: What keeps that from being a limit on customers is `type: "lambda"` + `lambdaArn`:
#: a function you already own, registered as a tool. Anything reachable from a Lambda
#: is reachable — a warehouse, an RDBMS, something inside a VPC, a gRPC service, a
#: vendor SDK — without touching this list.
#:
#: Validated HERE as well as in both IaC paths because the app used to default an
#: unrecognised type to "mcp" (`spec.get("type", "mcp")` in the Gateway client). A
#: deployment cannot reach that — plan/synth rejects the type first — but local dev and
#: a WORKFLOW_JSON override can, and it made a typo'd type issue a plausible-looking
#: MCP call instead of an error.
TOOL_TYPES = vocabulary.TOOL_TYPES

#: Long-term memory strategies an agent may name in `agentcore.memory.longTerm`.
#: These are the ones the IaC actually PROVISIONS on the AgentCore memory — see
#: `semantic_memory_strategy` / `summary_memory_strategy` in terraform/main.tf and the
#: equivalent in cdk/lib/orchestrator-stack.ts — and the ones `context._NS_PREFIX`
#: knows how to build a namespace for.
#:
#: Validated because an unrecognised value was SILENT: `_namespace_for` falls back to
#: using the strategy name as its own prefix, so `longTerm: ["userPreference"]`
#: searched `userPreference/<actor>` — a namespace nothing ever writes — found
#: nothing, and reported a successful recall. The observability panel showed memory
#: working. That is the exact failure mode `tests/test_config_keys.py` exists to
#: prevent, and it slipped through because the KEY was allowed and only its VALUE was
#: wrong. `user_preference` was listed in the code as supported for a while with no
#: strategy behind it, which is how this was found.
MEMORY_STRATEGIES = vocabulary.MEMORY_STRATEGIES
#: The only `source` value: the stand-in A2A server this repo ships. Like a tools
#: entry's `source`, it asks the framework to DEPLOY the thing and inject its URL,
#: because a Function URL is generated by the deploy and cannot be committed.
A2A_SOURCES = vocabulary.A2A_SOURCES
#: Skills the shipped stand-in publishes (a2a_lambda/handler.py SKILLS). Only

#: What a `tools` KEY may be, and it is narrower than either AWS constraint on its own,
#: because the key is used to build TWO names with INCOMPATIBLE rules:
#:
#:   the Gateway target      `<key>`            ^([0-9a-zA-Z][-]?){1,100}$   no underscores
#:   the Cedar policy        `permit_<key>`     ^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*$      no hyphens
#:
#: So `policy_docs` is refused by the first and `policy-docs` by the second, and the
#: intersection is alphanumeric. Which is no real imposition — camelCase is already the
#: house style throughout workflow.json (`maxTokens`, `agentCard`, `gateId`), so
#: `policyDocs` is the form that matches the rest of the file anyway.
#:
#: BOTH of these were found by deploying a foreign workflow, one after the other, each
#: after a clean `cdk synth`: CloudFormation refused the change set, which is the last
#: possible place to learn it. Every tool in the shipped sample is a single alphanumeric
#: word, so nothing had ever exercised a separator.
#:
#: Mirrored in cdk/lib/orchestrator-stack.ts, terraform/tools.tf and the generated schema.
