"""AgentCore Runtime entrypoint.

Long-running / async model: each invocation registers an async task
(app.add_async_task) and runs the workflow in a background task, returning to
the caller immediately. While a task is registered, /ping reports HealthyBusy,
keeping the session alive up to the 8-hour max lifetime. Progress is written to
DynamoDB (sink) for the UI; HITL pauses persist via AgentCore Memory and resume
on a later invocation.
