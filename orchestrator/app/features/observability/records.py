"""Telemetry record schema — one row per captured event.

Stored in the telemetry DynamoDB table (see store.py). PK = session_id,
SK = "ts#seq#rand" so events sort chronologically within a session. The by_date
GSI powers the aggregation views (by date / model / user).

`kind` says what the row is:
  llm        - a Bedrock model call (tokens, rates, cost, prompt I/O)
  tool       - a Gateway MCP / KB retrieve call
  agentcore  - AgentCore Runtime compute for one active burst
  memory     - a long-term memory recall or store
  guardrail  - a Bedrock Guardrails check on agent input/output
  policy     - a Cedar policy decision on a Gateway tool call
  eval       - one AgentCore Evaluations (LLM-as-judge) result
