"""MCP access through the AgentCore Gateway.

All MCP tools are reached through one authenticated Gateway endpoint. The runtime
fetches a short-lived client-credentials access token from the configured identity
provider and connects to the Gateway's MCP URL over Streamable HTTP.

There is NO simulated fallback: an unreachable or unpublished tool raises
ToolUnavailable, and a Cedar refusal raises ToolDenied (app/common/errors.py). The
framework never substitutes invented evidence for a tool that did not run.

The token request differs per IdP (GATEWAY_AUTH_FLOW, set by Terraform from the
`idp` variable) — see _token_request() below.

A successful call returns (text, "gateway"); anything else raises. The mode is kept
in the return shape because the telemetry rows and the UI record how the tool was
reached.

      cognito — the client authenticates with HTTP Basic (client_id:secret) and
                requests an OAuth2 `scope`. The resulting token carries
                `client_id` + `scope` and NO `aud`.

                `audience` (the API identifier). The resulting token carries
                `aud` + `azp` and no `client_id`.

    The Gateway's authorizer is configured to match (see terraform/gateway.tf).
    To add another OIDC provider, add a branch here and one in identity.tf.

    HTTPS is REQUIRED, and checked rather than assumed. This request carries the
    Gateway client secret — in the Authorization header for Cognito, in the form
    body for Auth0 — so a token URL that arrived misconfigured as `http://` would
    put those credentials on the wire in plaintext, and a `file://` one would make

    `_extract_chunks` renders a result for a model to read. This returns the same
    result as data, for an agent that COMPUTES its output instead of generating it
    (see app/subagents/cost_research/agent.py). A model handed a table of numbers
    will eventually do arithmetic nobody asked for — multiplying a real price by an
    assumed volume, or subtracting two timestamps — and report the result as though
    it had been measured. Where the output is a transformation of the rows, doing
    the transformation in code removes the opportunity instead of forbidding it.

    Such an agent needs the tool's fields, not its rendering. Reading them back out
    of the prose would couple the agent to one tool's exact sentence shape, which is
    the opposite of this framework's premise: a tool is a config entry, so pointing
    it at a different Lambda, warehouse or API must not require an agent code
    change. The FIELD NAMES are config too — see the tool's `rowFields` block in
    workflow.json.

    Returns [] when the tool returned no recognisable list, which the caller must
