"""Analysis contract — the step-3 (Analysis) asset.

Synthesizes the brief and the two research findings into one analysis. The core
of the contract is `claims`: every material claim is traced structurally to the
upstream assets that support it, so a reviewer can follow each assertion back to
its evidence rather than trusting prose. Assumptions and limitations are named
explicitly.
