"""Central configuration.

The workflow (agents + topology + HITL gates) is defined once in workflow.json
and loaded here. Everything else (graph, UI, BFF) derives from it, so adding an
agent is a config change plus a new agent module — no changes to the framework.

Load order for the workflow definition:
  1. WORKFLOW_JSON env var (inline JSON) — used by the Lambda BFF.
  2. app/workflow.json on disk — used by the runtime and local dev.

# guardrail). Environment variables still take precedence at deploy time.
ORCHESTRATOR: dict = WORKFLOW.get("orchestrator", {})

# How the orchestrator calls a DEDICATED agent runtime (app/common/agentcore_agent.py),
# and specifically WHETHER THE SDK MAY SILENTLY RUN AN AGENT TWICE.
#
# InvokeAgentRuntime is synchronous, slow (a research agent takes ~15-20s) and NOT
# idempotent: the remote container starts working the moment the request lands, and
# it has no idea whether the caller is still listening. boto3's default client
# enables retries — `retries={'mode': 'legacy'}`, up to 5 attempts — so one
# transient connection blip mid-call makes the SDK re-issue the request, the remote
# agent runs the WHOLE thing again, and the orchestrator returns whichever attempt
# answered last. The first attempt's model call is still billed, and nothing logs it:
# the node logs "Invoking dedicated AgentCore Runtime" once, before the retry exists.
#
# That is not hypothetical. On a live run the web_search runtime logged two
# invocations with different requestIds, 13s apart, for one node execution:
#   13:55:29  Invocation completed successfully (17.792s)  req 95297bd8...
#   13:55:41  Invocation completed successfully (16.669s)  req 26ad54ce...
# Two identical model calls, 6579 input tokens each, one result discarded, $0.0158
# of the run's $0.2448 spent on an answer nobody read.
#
# So retries are OFF by default here (maxAttempts 1 = one attempt, no retry) and the
# read timeout is generous instead. For a call this long the failure that matters is
# a LOST RESPONSE to work that already succeeded, and retrying that is strictly
# worse than failing: a raised error surfaces to the reviewer, whereas a duplicate
# silently double-bills. The framework already prefers a visible failure over a
# quiet degradation everywhere else (see app/common/errors.py).
#
#   maxAttempts         total attempts per invoke, not retries-after-the-first.
#                       1 disables retrying. Raise it only if you have made the
#                       call idempotent.
#   readTimeoutSeconds  how long to wait for the agent's response. Must exceed the
#                       slowest agent's wall-clock or you will time out mid-answer
#                       and, with maxAttempts 1, lose the run.

#
# Separate from runtimeInvoke on purpose. A dedicated runtime is ours: we know how
# slow it is and we control its timeout. A remote agent is somebody else's service
# behind an interface that is explicitly allowed to be slow — A2A models a unit of
# work as a Task precisely so it can take minutes and be polled — so the budget that
# matters is not one request timeout but how long we are willing to wait overall.

#   maxPollSeconds      total wall-clock before we give up and fail the run with the
#                       last state we saw. Bounded rather than open-ended: a task
#                       that never leaves "working" would otherwise hold the whole
