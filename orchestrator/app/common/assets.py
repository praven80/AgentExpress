"""Asset plumbing shared by BOTH agent runners.

`research.py` (agents that gather evidence from a tool) and `synthesis.py` (agents
that reason over upstream assets) are two different flows, but they need the same
five mechanics: read the run's brief, count this agent's version, slug a title,
parse the model's JSON, and normalise provenance. Those lived in both files —
`slug` and `prior_version` were byte-identical copies, and `extract_json` had
DIVERGED: only synthesis could salvage a JSON object the model truncated at its
token budget, even though research emits the largest payload of the two and is
therefore the more likely to be cut off.

Nothing here is domain-specific. A customer writing their own agent runner can
import these directly.
