"""A2AAgent — the node body for a step run by an agent THIS WORKFLOW DOES NOT OWN
(workflow.json `runtime: "a2a"`).

`main` and `dedicated` both run code that ships in this image. This is the third
placement and the only one where the agent is somebody else's service: a partner's,
another team's, or a managed one. It is reached over the Agent2Agent protocol at its
Agent Card URL, so nothing about it lives in this repo.

    "credit_check": {
      "name": "Partner Credit Check",
      "runtime": "a2a",
      "agentCard": "https://agents.partner.example/credit",
      "auth": "bearer",
      "produces": "credit-assessment"
    }

WHAT A2A ACTUALLY GIVES US, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
It is transport and discovery: how to find an agent and how to hand it a task. It
carries no opinion about WHICH agent to call — that stays this framework's job
(`steps` for the fixed order, `branch` for a decision from an output, a review gate
for a decision from a human). So an a2a agent slots into the topology exactly like
any other and every one of those mechanisms works on it unchanged.

THE WIRE
  1. GET  <card>/.well-known/agent-card.json   discovery; tells us where to POST
  2. POST <url>  {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"message/send","params":{"message":…}}
  3. the result is either a Message (answered inline) or a Task, and a Task may
     still be running — so poll `tasks/get` until it reaches a terminal state
  4. read the text parts out of the artifacts

Two shapes of the same thing have to be tolerated throughout, because the spec
renamed them and deployed agents lag: task states arrive as either `completed` or
`TASK_STATE_COMPLETED`, and a text part as either `{"kind":"text","text":…}` or bare
`{"text":…}`. Normalising on the way in is three lines; guessing wrong is a run that
hangs on a task that already finished.

WHAT DEGRADES, AND IT IS WORTH KNOWING
The framework wraps this call in OUR container, so guardrails and long-term memory
still apply to it. Two things cannot:
  * evaluations fall back to a role descriptor, because there is no local model call
    to capture a prompt from — the reasoning happened on their side;
  * any tool the remote agent uses is outside this deployment's Cedar policy. You are
    trusting their boundary, not enforcing yours.

NO NEW DEPENDENCY. stdlib urllib, https enforced, the blocking call moved to a
thread — the same shape as app/features/gateway/client.py, for the same reason: this
request can carry a bearer token.

        WHY THE FRAMEWORK DOES THIS AND NOT THE REMOTE AGENT. The envelope is
        BOOKKEEPING ABOUT THIS RUN, and a remote agent cannot know it: `version` is how
        many times this agent has run in THIS session (read from the graph's history),
        `createdByAgent` is the id THIS workflow gave the step, `assetType` is the
        `produces` THIS workflow declared, and `sourceAssetIds` are the ids of the
        upstream assets this graph chose to hand over. A remote agent asked to invent
        them would get the version wrong on every re-run — silently, because a wrong
        integer still validates.

        So the division is: the remote agent supplies the CONTENT, which is the only
        part it can legitimately know, and the framework supplies the envelope. That
        makes a `runtime: "a2a"` agent a first-class contract producer — it gets a real
        `assetId`, so a downstream agent can trace a claim to it and the UI renders it
        as a structured asset rather than a wall of text. Without this a remote agent's
        output had no assetId at all, and `synthesis.upstream_context` — which collects
        exactly that field — passed it to the model as an unattributable block, so a
        report could mention it in prose but never cite it.

        A PROSE reply is returned untouched. A reviewer agent that answers in sentences
        is a legitimate remote agent, and wrapping its text in a JSON envelope would
        make the timeline and the report worse, not better. Only a JSON OBJECT is
        treated as contract content.

        WHAT IS NOT DONE HERE, deliberately: the merged asset is not validated against
        a pydantic contract, because there is no local contract class for an agent whose
        code is somebody else's — `produces` names the type, it does not import a model.
        That is the real cost of the trust boundary, and it is the reason the UI renders
        an asset by SHAPE rather than by field name. A remote agent you need schema
        enforcement over belongs behind a `dedicated` wrapper that validates its reply.

        Fields the remote DID supply are kept. If a remote agent is contract-aware
        enough to send its own `executiveSummary`, `sources` or even `assetId`, that is
        its business — this fills the gaps rather than overwriting.
