"""Eastern-Time clock — the ONE place time is formatted for the whole project.

Every stored and displayed timestamp uses US Eastern Time (America/New_York)
in the format ``YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS``. This module is dependency-free (no tzdata
needed on Lambda or in the container): it computes the US Eastern UTC offset with
the statutory DST rule — EDT (UTC-4) from the 2nd Sunday of March 02:00 to the
1st Sunday of November 02:00, otherwise EST (UTC-5).

NOTE: bff/clock.py duplicates this module's CODE (the BFF Lambda ships as its own
zip and cannot import app.common). The two are kept in step by
tests/test_clock_parity.py, which compares their ASTs — the docstrings differ, and
a comment asking the next reader to "keep them in sync" was not keeping them in
sync.
