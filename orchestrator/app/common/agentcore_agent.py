"""AgentCoreRuntimeAgent — the orchestrator-side node body for an agent that runs
in its OWN AgentCore Runtime (workflow.json `runtime: "dedicated"`).

Instead of running the agent in-process, it calls bedrock-agentcore
InvokeAgentRuntime against that agent's dedicated runtime ARN, passing the same
inputs an in-process agent would read (topic, subject, upstream outputs,
reviewer feedback) and returning the runtime's output text. Same Agent
interface and node wrapper as an in-process agent, so the graph wiring is
identical — only where the compute happens differs.

The per-agent runtime ARNs are injected by Terraform as AGENT_RUNTIME_ARNS
(a JSON map of agent_id -> runtime ARN).
