"""Base class for agents.

Every agent is a package under app/subagents/<name>/ (agent.py with an Agent
subclass implementing run(), plus __init__.py doing `from .agent import agent`),
listed under "agents" in workflow.json and placed in "steps".

Its `runtime` decides WHERE it runs, not what it does:
  * "main" (default) — runs in-process as a node in the orchestrator runtime.
  * "dedicated"      — runs in its OWN AgentCore Runtime (provisioned by Terraform
                       from workflow.json); the orchestrator invokes it via
                       InvokeAgentRuntime. Same run() code either way.

Its `agentcore` block declares which AgentCore features it uses (memory,
guardrails, evaluations, policy, …). The framework applies them around run()
based on that config, so enabling a capability for an agent is a workflow.json
edit — not a code change. See app/features/ for what each one does.

The framework wires either mode into the graph, status tracking, and UI.

    # after it, which is what makes memory purely config-driven for an ordinary
    # in-process agent. Neither is right for an agent whose work happens somewhere
    # else, so the two are separate flags rather than one.
    #
    # Both were unconditionally true, and for a `dedicated` agent that was a measured
    # defect on both counts. The RECALL was computed, billed, written to the telemetry
    # table as a recall row — and then thrown away, because `recalled_memory` is only
    # ever consumed by `ctx.llm` (app/common/context.py) and the InvokeAgentRuntime
    # payload does not carry it. The STORE ran twice, once here and once inside the
    # dedicated container (app/subagent_runtime.py), writing the same insight to the
    # same actor namespace twice per run — and duplicates are then recalled as two
    # copies, which skews what the extraction strategy makes of them.
