"""Cost Research — what the requested use case costs to run (step 2, parallel).

The `type: "lambda"` demonstration. Bound by workflow.json to a tool whose target
is an AWS Lambda function, which is how an agent reaches anything the Gateway
cannot reach directly: a warehouse (Redshift, Snowflake), any RDBMS, an internal
service, a resource inside a VPC, or — as here — a control-plane API with no MCP
server in front of it. Here the function queries the AWS Price List Query API.

Note what is NOT in this file: no Lambda ARN, no argument names, no tool name, no
IAM. All of it is the tool's entry in workflow.json — `source` (or `lambdaArn`),
`toolSchema`, `call` and `arg`. Swapping the function for one that prices your own
private rate card is a config edit, and this file does not change.

WHY COST
Whatever the use case, someone will ask what it costs, and before this the answer
was always "no cost figures were supplied" — correctly, because nothing supplied
any. That leaves an agent two options: say nothing useful, or invent a number. The
second is the dangerous one. A fabricated "$50,000 budget" is indistinguishable
from a real estimate once it is in a report, which is why this agent asks the model
for a service LIST and never for a number.

THE SPLIT: JUDGEMENT TO THE MODEL, ARITHMETIC TO CODE
This agent makes exactly ONE model call, and it is not the one you would expect.

  MODEL   "which AWS services would this use case need?" — a genuinely semantic
          question. It reads the brief and answers with service names.
  CODE    "what do those services cost?" — a factual question, answered by the
          tool against the real Price List API, and reported verbatim.

The model never sees a price. It cannot round one, mis-transcribe one, or multiply
two together, because by the time prices exist its work is finished. That is the
same division a customer deployment of this framework draws for money: budget
splits and creator mixes are computed in code and the model is told plainly that
"the arithmetic is computed deterministically by the system; your job is the
PLANNING NARRATIVE".

WHY THERE IS NO TOTAL, AND WHY THAT IS THE HONEST ANSWER
A total needs volumes — how many tokens per request, how many requests per month,
how much stored. Those are properties of the customer's workload, not of AWS, and
a five-word request contains none of them. An agent that multiplies a real rate by
a volume nobody gave it has invented the volume, and the invented half is the half
that makes the total wrong.

So this agent publishes the RATES and names the volumes a total would need. If a
later agent then states a total, it must have got the volumes from somewhere real —
and if it invented them, `unsupported-figure` catches it, because the figure will
not appear in any upstream asset. The pipeline's existing guardrail does the rest.
