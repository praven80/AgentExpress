"""Shared runner for the research sub-agents.

Every research agent shares one flow, regardless of where its evidence comes
from — the difference is one line of config (its `tool`), not code:

  1. take the approved request brief (from the intake agent upstream),
  2. gather grounding evidence from the tool the agent is bound to (Knowledge
     Base, Web Search, a remote MCP server, or a REST API), or none at all,
  3. reason over that evidence and produce a structured analysis with every
     finding classified by evidence type and every data limitation named,
  4. assemble and validate a ResearchOutput asset (contract-adherent).

Step 3 is the only one an agent may replace, through the `think` hook on
`synthesize`. Its default is a single `ctx.llm` call; the shipped agents use it
to show that the reasoning step can be authored with whatever agentic framework
you prefer without disturbing steps 1, 2 and 4:

  documentation_search  plain ctx.llm — no framework at all
  cost_research         plain ctx.llm, and its own run() rather than this runner
  web_search            Strands Agents
  knowledge_research    a nested LangGraph subgraph

All four still bind their data source in workflow.json and still emit the same
ResearchOutput contract, so the framework is an authoring choice and nothing more.
Anything with a `think` hook works here — CrewAI, LlamaIndex, your own loop — as
long as it reaches the model through `ctx.llm`. Only Strands is in
requirements.txt, because every agent shares one container image and so pays for
every framework in it; see the note there before adding a second.

This is framework plumbing (like ctx.llm); each agent keeps only its own
identity — its prompt, its data source, and how it likes to reason.

#
# Keep whatever your version says about citations: the URL rules below are not
# style, they are what makes the citation verification downstream meaningful.
RESEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS = (
    "\n=== HOW TO USE THESE INPUTS ===\n"
    "1. The REQUEST above is the APPROVED, AUTHORITATIVE input. Treat it as "
    "complete and current.\n"
    "2. Label a finding 'sourced-fact' ONLY when the value appears in an "
    "EVIDENCE block above. If a value is not present in these inputs, do not "
    "assert it; use 'assumption' or 'agent-interpretation', or omit it. Every "
    "finding's sourceRef must name an input actually shown above.\n"
    "3. A FINDING IS ABOUT THE SUBJECT, NEVER ABOUT THE REQUEST. Every reader "
    "downstream already has the request; a finding that describes it spends one of "
    "the few slots they read on nothing. This is the single most common defect in "
    "this agent's output, and it always takes one of these shapes:\n"
    "     'The request brief identifies six key questions…'\n"
    "     'The request brief assumes an LLM will power the agent…'\n"
    "     'The brief does not specify which stage is intended…'\n"
    "   Each is a true sentence about the wrong subject. Put what the request does "
    "not settle in dataLimitations (item 4 — that list is FOR this), and keep "
    "findings for what the evidence says or what you concluded about the topic:\n"
    "     NOT  'The brief does not specify a deployment target.'\n"
    "     BUT  'Deployment target drives the orchestration choice: the retrieved "
    "guidance ties durable pause/resume to a managed runtime.' + a dataLimitations "
    "entry naming the unspecified target.\n"
    "   SELF-CHECK BEFORE RETURNING: delete any finding whose statement a reader "
    "could verify by reading the REQUEST alone. If the reader already has it, it "
    "is not a finding. Prefer 3-8 findings that pass this test over a longer list "
    "that does not.\n"
    "3a. CITATIONS. Each evidence item is numbered and may carry 'title:', "
    "'url:' and 'published:'. When a finding comes from one, its sourceRef MUST "
    "be that item's url when it has one (copy it character for character), or "
    "its title when it does not. NEVER write a url that is not shown above — "
    "not even a plausible-looking one. Reproduce every url you were given in "
    "`sources` so it can be displayed to the reader; omit `url` for an item "
    "that had none.\n"
    "3b. Cite the item that ACTUALLY CONTAINS the claim. Before writing a "
    "sourceRef, find the sentence you are relying on and use the url of the item "
    "it sits in — not a related item, and not whichever item is most prominent. "
    "An agent attributed 'Strands, CrewAI and LangGraph' to the Bedrock Agents "
    "page when those names appeared only in a different retrieved article: the "
    "claim was true, the citation sent the reader to the wrong document, and a "
    "reviewer checking it finds nothing. If one finding rests on two items, name "
    "both. If you cannot point to the item that carries it, it is not a "
    "sourced-fact.\n"
    "3c. RULE 3 APPLIES TO `summary` TOO, which is the line most likely to be read "
    "and the last place this defect survived. \"The retrieved sources directly "
    "address the request's scope and key questions\" tells a reader nothing they "
    "did not already know, and spends the one sentence you have on the wrong "
    "subject. Open with the substance instead \u2014 \"Ingestion choice turns on "
    "ordering guarantees: Kinesis preserves order per shard, SQS does not unless "
    "FIFO\" \u2014 and leave what the request omits to dataLimitations.\n"
    "4. dataLimitations is the home for BOTH kinds of gap: evidence you needed and "
    "did not get (the tool returned nothing relevant for this query), AND anything "
    "the request leaves unsettled that your analysis would have needed. Both are "
    "useful to a reviewer and neither is a finding. Return [] if you had what you "
    "needed. Do not name something as missing that the evidence above actually "
    "shows.\n"
    "4a. ONE GAP, ONE ENTRY, AND KEEP IT SHORT. Do not restate the same gap in "
    "several wordings, and do not walk the request's question list turning each "
    "one into its own entry — a reviewer reading seven variations of 'the request "
    "does not specify X' learns what two would have told them, and every "
    "downstream agent then repeats all seven. Name the gaps that actually blocked "
    "YOUR work, most consequential first. Never list the REQUEST itself, or any "
    "upstream asset shown above, as missing evidence: they are here.\n"
    "5. Counts must match the lists they count. No figure and no numbered "
    "sequence that the inputs above do not contain.\n"

    """Run the evidence-gathering flow and return a validated ResearchOutput as JSON.

    Data access is entirely CONFIG-driven: the agent's `tool` field in
    workflow.json names an entry in the `tools` block, and that entry's `type`
    decides how the call is made — Knowledge Base retrieval, the managed Web
    Search connector, a remote MCP server, an OpenAPI-described REST API, or your
    own Lambda. For a Knowledge Base tool the agent's `corpus` scopes retrieval to
    one document set.

    An agent with no `tool` reasons purely over its upstream inputs. A tool that
    cannot be called RAISES (ToolUnavailable / ToolDenied) — the run fails with the
    reason on the failing agent rather than continuing without the evidence.

    So a new agent of this kind needs a folder and a workflow.json entry, nothing
    here. What you CAN vary from your agent folder:
      * `system_prompt`  — who the agent is (app/subagents/<id>/prompts.py)
      * `instructions`   — how it should use the inputs; defaults to the
                           domain-neutral RESEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS above
      * `think`          — WHO DOES THE REASONING. Defaults to `ctx.llm`, a single
                           model call. Pass your own to author the reasoning step
                           with an agentic framework of your choice — Strands,
                           CrewAI, LangGraph, anything — while the evidence
                           gathering above and the contract below stay put. See
                           strands_bridge.py in this folder for a worked example
                           of satisfying a framework's model-provider interface
                           with `ctx.llm` (a CrewAI `BaseLLM` or a LangChain
                           `BaseChatModel` is the same shape), and the four
                           research agents for the three ways they are wired:
                           Strands, a nested LangGraph, and no framework.

                           WHATEVER YOU PASS MUST REACH THE MODEL THROUGH
                           `ctx.llm`. That is not a style rule: guardrails, cost
                           and token telemetry, long-term memory injection,
                           truncation detection and cancellation all live in
                           `ctx.llm`, so a framework holding its own Bedrock
                           client silently loses every one of them and the run
                           still reports success.
    What you cannot vary here is the OUTPUT SHAPE, which is the ResearchOutput
    contract. To emit something else, write your own `run()` and return your own
    contract — this runner is a convenience, not a requirement.
