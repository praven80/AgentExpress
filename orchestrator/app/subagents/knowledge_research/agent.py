"""Knowledge Base Research — RAG over your own documents (step 2, parallel).

Its data source is DECLARED, not coded: workflow.json binds this agent to the
tool named by its `tool` field (type="kb") and scopes retrieval to its `corpus`.
The shared runner in app/subagents/_shared/research.py does the rest.

To point this at your own documents, replace the contents of kb_docs/ — each
top-level folder is a corpus. No change here.

AUTHORED WITH A NESTED LANGGRAPH. Its sibling research agents use Strands, CrewAI,
and no framework at all. LangGraph is already this repo's outer orchestrator, and
there is nothing stopping an agent from running a graph of its own inside a single
node of that one — which is what this does.

It earns the second framework here rather than just wrapping one call: the graph
has a conditional edge, so an unusable draft gets ONE repair attempt instead of
failing the run. The happy path still costs exactly one model call, the same as
before, because the check between the two nodes is plain Python and not a model.
