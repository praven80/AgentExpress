"""Authorization for the actions a human can take on a run.

The JWT authorizer on /api/* answers "is this a valid user?". It does NOT answer
"may THIS user approve a review gate?". Without that second question, any
authenticated user can approve, deny, re-run or cancel any run — which for a
human-in-the-loop product is the wrong default.

This module answers it, driven entirely by the `authorization` block in
app/workflow.json:

    "authorization": {
      "groupsClaim": "cognito:groups",
      "actions": {
        "decision": ["approvers"],
        "rerun":    ["approvers"],
        "cancel":   ["approvers", "operators"],
        "evaluate": ["operators"],
        "insights": ["operators"]
      }
    }

Semantics, chosen so the default stays backwards compatible:

  * An action NOT listed in `actions` is unrestricted — any authenticated caller
    may perform it. So an absent or empty `authorization` block behaves exactly as
    before this module existed.
  * An action listed with a non-empty group list requires the caller to hold at
    least ONE of those groups.
  * An action listed with an EMPTY list is denied to everyone. That is deliberate:
    it is how you switch a capability off entirely.

`groupsClaim` is configurable because providers differ: Cognito issues
`cognito:groups`, while Auth0 needs a namespaced custom claim added by an action
(e.g. "https://your-app/roles"). Read-only endpoints are not gated here — they are
already behind the authorizer, and hiding a run from a reviewer who can see the UI
buys nothing.
