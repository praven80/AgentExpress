"""A real A2A server, so the `runtime: "a2a"` placement ships with something live.

Every other capability in this sample has a working agent proving it: `kb` has one,
`websearch` has one, `mcp` has one, `lambda` has one. `a2a` had documentation and a
test suite, and nothing you could watch run — because that placement needs an agent
THIS DEPLOYMENT DOES NOT OWN, and a committed placeholder URL would have failed every
run. So the framework deploys a stand-in: a genuine A2A server, in its own Lambda,
behind its own Function URL, reached over the protocol exactly as a third party's
agent would be.

It is a STAND-IN, not a mock. It speaks real JSON-RPC 2.0, publishes a real Agent
Card, and answers by really calling Bedrock. The only fiction is the org chart: it
happens to live in your account. Cross that out and nothing about the client changes
— which is the property worth demonstrating.

    "analysis": {                      <- the shipped sample's own stage 3
      "name": "Analysis",
      "runtime": "a2a",
      "source": "a2a_lambda",          <- the framework deploys me and injects my URL
      "skill": "analysis",             <- which of my skills; a PATH segment, see below
      "auth": "sigv4",                 <- required with `source`: my URL is AWS_IAM
      "produces": "analysis"
    }

Point an agent at a real partner instead and this function stops being deployed:
`"agentCard": "https://theirs.example/agent"` and `source` goes away, the same way a
`tools` entry swaps `source` for `lambdaArn`.

THE THREE ENDPOINTS, per the A2A spec and the AgentCore A2A contract
  GET  /.well-known/agent-card.json  discovery: identity, skills, where to POST
  POST /                             JSON-RPC 2.0: `message/send`, `tasks/get`
  GET  /ping                         health

WHY IT ANSWERS SYNCHRONOUSLY. A2A lets a server return a Task that is still `working`
and be polled. This one finishes inside the request because a Lambda has nowhere to
keep a task between invocations — there is no store here, and inventing one would be
inventing infrastructure the demonstration does not need. The client handles both, and
`tests/test_a2a.py` covers the polling path; a real partner with a queue behind it will
exercise it.

SECURITY. The Function URL is `AWS_IAM`, so this endpoint is not public: a caller must
present a SigV4 signature from a principal allowed to invoke it, which is the
orchestrator's execution role and nothing else. That is why the client has an
`auth: "sigv4"` mode — no bearer token exists to leak, nothing to rotate, and no
secret in `workflow.json`. A Function URL with `authType: NONE` guarded by a shared
token would have been less code and materially worse.

# Skills
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A catalogue, not a fixed roster. `workflow.json` picks which of these are actually
# wired up as agents, so adding a remote step to a pipeline is a workflow.json edit and
# nothing else — and a skill nobody names simply is not reached. Each skill is a role
# plus a shape, which is exactly what an agent under app/subagents/ carries in its
# prompts.py: from the orchestrator's side there is no way to tell this one lives
# somewhere else.
#
# TWO KINDS OF SKILL HERE, on purpose.
#
#   `compliance` / `resilience` — REVIEWERS, and their shape is their own. This is the
#   normal case for a third party: they have an output format, it is not ours, and
#   demanding ours is what makes a partner agent un-integrable.
#
#   `analysis` / `recommendation` — CONTRACT PRODUCERS. Their shape is the CONTENT of
#   this sample's Analysis and Recommendation contracts, because these two are steps in
#   the deliverable rather than commentary on it: the report agent traces its sections
#   back to them. Note what is NOT in these shapes — assetId, version, status,
#   createdAt, createdByAgent, sourceAssetIds. Those are bookkeeping about the
#   orchestrator's run, the remote agent cannot know them (it has no idea how many
#   times it has been re-run in this session), and A2AAgent._as_asset stamps them on
#   the way back. Asking for them here is how you get `"version": 1` on a revise.
#
# WHY THE GROUNDING RULES ARE SPELLED OUT AT LENGTH BELOW. An in-process synthesis
# agent gets them for free: app/subagents/_shared/synthesis.py appends nine rules to
# every prompt. That code does not cross the boundary, so a remote agent that is not
# told "no figure that is not in an upstream asset" will invent one. The rules are the
# same rules, in the place that can still apply them — which is the honest shape of
# outsourcing a step: the standard travels with the work.
