# --- CloudWatch Transaction Search (account-wide, one-time) ----------------
#
# AgentCore Observability and the Evaluations/Insights features read agent OTEL
# spans from the CloudWatch "aws/spans" log group. Those spans only land there
# once Transaction Search is enabled for the account (it switches X-Ray span
# ingestion into CloudWatch Logs). That is normally a manual console step per new
# account; we provision it here so a fresh-account deploy is self-contained.
#
# Transaction Search is an ACCOUNT-WIDE SINGLETON, so the native
# AWS::XRay::TransactionSearchConfig resource can only ever CREATE it and errors
# with "AlreadyExists" on any account where it is already on. To make the deploy
# idempotent (never fail when it's already enabled), we enable it via an
# idempotent CLI step that checks the current state first — mirroring the
# null_resource + local-exec pattern used for the image build and KB ingestion.

# Resource policy letting X-Ray deliver spans to the aws/spans (and
# application-signals) log groups. This one IS safe to manage in Terraform: it is
# keyed by name and updates in place, so it never hits the singleton problem.
