# --- AgentCore Optimization: Insights ---------------------------------------
#
# AgentCore Optimization is used here via INSIGHTS: a cross-run
# bedrock-agentcore:StartBatchEvaluation with the built-in insight analyzers
# (FailureAnalysis / UserIntent / ExecutionSummary). Findings are stored in the
# DynamoDB table below (a single reserved item, id="latest") and surfaced in the
# Observability -> Insights tab.
#
# Requires CloudWatch Transaction Search (transaction_search.tf) so the runtime
# traces the analyzers read are indexed.
#
# Not wired: per-prompt Recommendations (StartRecommendation). Its session
# reconstruction does not accept a multi-agent orchestrator's trace structure —
# it reports "no sessions identified from input agent traces" even with
# correctly-formatted, X-Ray-indexed traces. Insights works, so that is what this
# sample implements.

# Small key-value store for the latest Insights run (id/arn/status + findings
# JSON, keyed id="latest").
