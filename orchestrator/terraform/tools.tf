# ===========================================================================
# TOOLS — every Gateway target and every Cedar permit, derived from ONE config
# ===========================================================================
# This file reads the `tools` block in app/workflow.json and generates:
#
#   * one AgentCore Gateway target per entry (kb / websearch / mcp / openapi)
#   * one vaulted API-key credential provider per entry that needs a key
#   * the Cedar policy statements that permit exactly those tools
#
# A customer adds a data source by adding a JSON block to workflow.json — no
# Terraform edits. Nothing here is specific to this sample's three tools.
#
# The map KEY is the Gateway target name AND the label an agent references via
# its `tool` field. AgentCore names every tool "<targetName>___<toolName>", and
# that string is also the Cedar action id.

# The KB target lives in kb.tf (it needs the retrieve Lambda + tool schema).

# --- Managed AgentCore Web Search connector -------------------------------
# A built-in connector, so there is no endpoint, no credentials and no schema to
# maintain: the Gateway resolves and authenticates to the AWS-owned backend
# itself, and queries never leave AWS. The tool surfaces as "<name>___WebSearch".
#
# DOMAIN FILTERING IS ONE KEY AND ONE PLACE: `domains: {include, exclude}` in
# workflow.json, applied on the target below. Hidden from the calling agent and
# applied by the Gateway to every request, so it is a boundary rather than a
# preference.
#
# The connector also ACCEPTS a domain filter per request, and this used to expose
# that as a second pair of keys (includeDomains / excludeDomains) beside a
# target-level pair (targetIncludeDomains / targetExcludeDomains). Four keys, one
# intent, and the pair with the obvious name was the weaker one — a request-level
# filter is caller-supplied, so it is scoping rather than a boundary, and it
# additionally needs connector v1.2.0+. Since both lists came from the same config
# file, setting both only ever produced their intersection, which a customer could
# have written directly. Nothing was lost by removing the request-level pair.
#
# publishedFrom / publishedTo stay request-level (app/features/gateway/client.py),
# because the target has no equivalent — there is no stronger place to put them.

# --- Your own Lambda functions --------------------------------------------
# The general-purpose escape hatch. Anything the Gateway cannot reach directly —
# Redshift, Snowflake, an RDBMS, an internal service, a resource inside a VPC — is
# reachable by pointing at a Lambda that fronts it. The framework does NOT create
# the function: you deploy it however you already deploy Lambdas, and declare its
# ARN here.
#
# Unlike an MCP server there is no tools/list to call, so the tool schema is
# DECLARED rather than discovered. One function may publish several tools; the
# Gateway passes the tool name through so the handler can dispatch on it.
#
# The Gateway invokes the function with its OWN execution role (the
# gateway_iam_role credential provider), so there is no secret anywhere.
# --- The built-in demo function (`source: "pricing"` -> app/tools/pricing/) -
# Deployed only when a tools entry asks for it. It exists so `type: "lambda"` is
# demonstrable out of the box without asking you to stand up a database first: it
# answers from the PUBLIC AWS Price List Query API, so the rates it returns are real
# and nothing has to be provisioned or seeded for them.
#
# Its execution role is FIXED — logs plus read-only on the PUBLIC AWS price list —
# which is exactly why `source` accepts no other value. That role is right for this
# one function and wrong for almost any other: a warehouse connector needs VPC
# config and a secret, an RDBMS connector needs credentials, and none of that can be
# expressed in workflow.json. So YOUR connector is a function you deploy, declared
# with `lambdaArn`; the framework registers it as a Gateway target and grants the
# Gateway invoke on it, and touches neither its code nor its role. Keep its source
# beside this one in app/tools/<name>/ if you like the symmetry — nothing in the
# framework reads it there unless `source` names it.
