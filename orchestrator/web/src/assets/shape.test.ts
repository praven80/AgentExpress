/** The shape-driven renderer, asserted against a contract the framework has never seen.
 *
 *  This is the UI half of the framework's central promise: a customer defines their own
 *  asset type, with their own field names, and it still gets first-class layout. The
 *  fixture is deliberately a claims-settlement asset, not this sample's research
 *  finding, because a test written against the shipped contract would pass even if the
 *  renderer hardcoded its field names.
 *
 *  Replaces tests/test_asset_rendering.py, which sliced functions out of the old
 *  single-file page with a regex and ran them under node. */
