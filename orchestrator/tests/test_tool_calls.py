"""How a `tools` entry becomes an actual tool call.

Three pure functions in app/features/gateway/client.py carry the whole "any MCP
server / any REST API from config alone" claim:

  _tool_arguments — the argument shape, including the parameter NAME, from config
  _select_tool    — which published tool to invoke, given the Gateway's naming
  _extract_chunks — flattening a result into evidence, keeping its citations

They are the config plane for the tool layer, so they are worth pinning exactly.
`TOOLS` is a module-level binding read from config, so each test patches it
directly rather than re-importing the world.
