"""A response that ran out of room must never look like a finished one.

`assets.extract_json` deliberately repairs JSON that was cut off mid-object, so a
model call that hit its `maxTokens` ceiling still yields a usable partial asset
instead of failing the run. That is the right trade — a report missing its last
source beats no report — but it has a nasty property: the repaired payload VALIDATES.
The asset looks complete, the run reports success, and the only remaining evidence
that anything was lost is the stop reason.

Observed live on "Build agentic ai app": the `analysis` call stopped at exactly its
6000-token budget, mid-way through writing a `sources` entry. The timeline said
"Analysis complete (v1)". The reviewer approved it at the gate. Nothing anywhere said
the tail was missing.

So: `run_llm` reports whether the response was truncated, `ctx.llm` puts it on the
run timeline and records it on the context, and each agent puts it on its asset using
that contract's own field for "something here is not sound".
