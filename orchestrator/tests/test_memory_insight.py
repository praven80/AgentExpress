"""What reaches long-term memory — the one write whose mistakes outlive the run.

A bad prompt produces a bad report and the next run gets another chance. A bad
long-term memory record is recalled by EVERY later run until someone deletes the
namespace, and the two failures observed live were exactly that:

  * the whole asset JSON was stored, so recall came back as bookkeeping
    ("asset ID: asset-analysis-…-v2, version 2, status: in-review"), and
  * the extraction model inferred things about the requester that nobody said
    ("the user's background (hands-on with AWS serverless, Lambda, DynamoDB)
    suggests …" for a request whose entire text was five words), which a later
    run then cited as the rationale for a recommendation.

So `_insight_from` condenses the asset to prose and strips sentences that are
about the requester or about this system's own run history.
