"""The config surface as a CUSTOMER meets it: one spec, a canonical shape, and an
editor that can answer their questions before they deploy.

Three planes already reject a bad `workflow.json` with good messages. All three do it
AFTER you have finished editing and run something, and the questions a customer has
are earlier than that — which keys may this agent have, which are required, what values
are allowed, what does this one do. `app/keys.json` answers them, `build_schema.py`
turns that into `app/workflow.schema.json`, and `$schema` in workflow.json is what makes
an editor use it.

WHAT THIS FILE IS ACTUALLY GUARDING
A generated schema is a FOURTH encoding of rules that already exist in Python, CDK and
Terraform. This repo has spent real effort deleting the second and third copies of
things (`app/vocabulary.json` exists because the closed value sets were written out in
three languages and drifted), so adding a fourth needs a reason to trust it. A schema
that DISAGREED with the validators would be worse than no schema at all: an editor
saying a config is fine and a deploy rejecting it teaches a customer to ignore the
editor.

So the tests below are mostly about agreement, in both directions:
  * the schema accepts the shipped workflow, and accepts a foreign one;
  * the schema rejects each mistake the other planes reject;
  * the schema is in sync with the spec it is generated from;
  * the spec is in sync with the vocabulary it references;
  * the canonical key order the formatter writes is the order the spec declares.
