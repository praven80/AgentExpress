"""A2A — delegating a step to an agent this workflow does not operate.

`main` and `dedicated` run code from this image. `runtime: "a2a"` is the third
placement and the only one across a trust boundary: the agent is somebody else's
service, reached over the Agent2Agent protocol at its Agent Card URL.

That boundary is what these tests are about. Every other agent fails in ways we can
see; this one fails in ways only the remote side knows, so the contract worth pinning
is: the request we send is the shape the protocol specifies, the answer we read is
found wherever the protocol allows it to be, and anything else surfaces as
`RemoteAgentUnavailable` with their reason attached rather than as an empty asset.

The wire is stubbed at `urllib.request.urlopen` — the one seam the client uses — so
these run with no network, no credentials and no partner agent. The request bodies are
asserted against the published shapes (JSON-RPC 2.0 `message/send`, Agent Card at
`/.well-known/agent-card.json`), because an integration that silently sends the wrong
field looks identical to one that works until a real partner rejects it.

TWO SHAPES OF EVERYTHING. The spec renamed task states and part discriminators, and
deployed agents lag, so both forms are in the wild: `completed` / `TASK_STATE_COMPLETED`
and `{"kind":"text"}` / `{"type":"text"}` / a bare `{"text":…}`. Reading only the
current form is a run that hangs on a task that already finished, which is why every
one of those is a case below.

    An agent answers the shape it was given, so a shape naming a field the contract
    forbids produces an invalid asset every single time — and nothing on the client side
    notices, because the framework has no contract class for a remote agent and does not
    validate. That is the documented cost of the boundary, and it makes this the only
    place the mismatch can be caught: at the point where we WRITE the shape down.

    It found a live one from the other direction too. `extra="forbid"` on these contracts
    means a remote agent inventing one field invalidates the whole asset: observed on a
    real run, one claim out of twenty-one carried its own `rationale`. A shape cannot
    stop that on its own, so rule 10 in the prompt says so explicitly — but it can at
    least guarantee that an agent which follows the shape EXACTLY produces something
    valid, and that is what this asserts.
