"""Every key in workflow.json must be one something actually reads.

This file exists because the config had drifted into carrying keys nothing
consumed. Some were harmless duplication (`agentcore.runtime.mode` restating the
agent's top-level `runtime`), but three were worse — they read like switches and
did nothing:

    agentcore.gateway.targets        looked like a per-agent tool allow-list; the
                                     real controls are the `tool` binding and the
                                     generated Cedar permit
    agentcore.observability.enabled  looked like an off switch; telemetry is
                                     captured for every agent regardless
    agentcore.memory.shortTerm       looked per-agent; the LangGraph checkpointer
                                     is deployment-wide

A config key that appears to control something and doesn't is worse than no key at
all, because a reader will believe it. So the allow-lists are deliberately CLOSED:
adding a key to workflow.json without wiring it up fails here.

WHERE THE ALLOW-LISTS LIVE, AND WHY THEY MOVED
They used to be four dicts at the top of this file. That worked, and it put the
answer to "which keys may an agent have?" inside a TEST — so a customer had to read
the test suite to find out, docs/WORKFLOW_REFERENCE.md restated it in prose, and an
editor could not help at all. Three copies of one fact, one of them in a file nobody
adopting the framework would think to open.

They live in `app/keys.json` now, beside `app/vocabulary.json`: that file closes the
VALUES, this one closes the KEYS. Four consumers read it — this module,
`format_workflow.py` for the canonical key order, `build_schema.py` for the JSON
Schema an editor validates against as you type, and the reference doc. The tests
below still do the enforcing; they no longer own the list.

# `publishedFrom`/`publishedTo` reached the app under Terraform and not under CDK. Then
# `rowPath` was added to config.py and to NEITHER IaC path, and a live agent read zero

# The same problem app/vocabulary.json solved for allowed VALUES, one level over: a
# default is a decision about what an omitted key means, and it was written out once per
# plane. `runtime: "main"` appeared FIFTEEN times across Python, HCL and TypeScript;
# `arg: "query"` three times; `corpusKey: "doc_type"` three times.
#
# And it had already produced a real defect, in a single file: terraform/tools.tf applied
# `try(t.maxResults, 10)` to EVERY tool including the Knowledge Base one, then separately
# re-read the kb spec with a `5` fallback. Two different defaults for one key, in one
# plane, where only the second reached the KB Lambda.
#
# A drifted default is quieter than a drifted allow-list, which is what makes this worth a
# test. A missing VALUE is rejected at plan or synth with a message naming it. A default
# that differs by plane deploys cleanly on BOTH and behaves differently, and the difference
# is whatever the key controls — indistinguishable from the feature working.
