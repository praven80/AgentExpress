"""Shared harness for the config-plane tests.

These tests exercise the code that TRANSLATES `workflow.json` into a running
system — the topology derivation, the graph wiring, the tool call shapes, the
contract coercion and the RBAC rules. They call no AWS APIs and no model, so they
run in about a second and are safe to run in CI.

Why a harness is needed
-----------------------
`app/common/config.py` reads the workflow ONCE, at import, and binds `AGENTS`,
`STEPS`, `FIRST_AGENT_ID` and `LAST_AGENT_ID` as module-level values. Other
modules then bind those same objects (`graph_builder` imports `STEPS`,
`registry` imports `AGENTS`). That is the right design for a container that serves
one workflow for its whole life, but it means a test cannot simply mutate config
and re-call a function: the bindings are already made.

`workflow()` below therefore sets `WORKFLOW_JSON` and re-imports the `app`
package tree from scratch, so each test gets a genuinely fresh view. That is also
exactly what a customer does when they swap the file, which is the behaviour under
test.
