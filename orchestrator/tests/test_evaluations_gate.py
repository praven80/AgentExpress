"""`agentcore.evaluations.enabled` is enforced where it cannot be bypassed.

The defect this file exists for: `is_enabled()` was defined in
`app/features/evaluations/service.py` and had **zero callers**. The only thing reading
the config key was `web/observability.js`, which hides the Evaluate button — and a
client-side gate is not enforcement. Anyone who called the REST route, or asked the
in-app assistant, or was reached by `auto_evaluate_session`, had the agent scored and
BILLED against the AgentCore Evaluations API, with a `kind="eval"` telemetry row
written, under `_DEFAULT_EVALUATORS` the agent never declared.

That is the exact failure `tests/test_config_keys.py` was written to prevent — a key
that reads like a switch and controls nothing — one level deeper, in the enforcement
rather than in the vocabulary.

The gate is in `evaluate_agent` because that is the single function EVERY path goes
through: the UI button and REST route (via `runtime._run_eval`), the assistant's
`run_evaluation` tool, and `auto_evaluate_session`. Gating at the callers is what
produced the bug — one caller was gated and the others were not.
