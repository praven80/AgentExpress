"""The LangGraph graph actually compiles for arbitrary topologies.

`build_graph` is the piece that makes `steps` executable. A topology it cannot
wire is not a bad answer — it is a container that crashes on start, after a
successful deploy. So the point of these tests is coverage of SHAPES: single
agents, parallel groups, sequence groups, gated and ungated, in the awkward
positions (first step, last step, back to back).

Compiling is a real assertion here, not a smoke test: `add_conditional_edges`
validates that every routing target is a declared node, so a mis-wired gate fails
at compile time.
