"""Citation verification — a URL is kept only if the model was actually shown it.

The prompt tells the model never to invent a URL. A prompt is not a control: a
fabricated link is indistinguishable from a real citation to whoever reads the
output. So `assets.build_sources` and `research._findings` check every URL against
the evidence block the model was given, drop what they cannot verify, and downgrade
a "sourced-fact" whose only provenance was an invented link.

A live run caught the model doing exactly this, which is why the check exists
rather than being theoretical.
