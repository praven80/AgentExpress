"""Topology derivation from `workflow.json`.

Everything here used to be implicit. `FIRST_AGENT_ID` was the hardcoded string
"intake", so renaming the first agent silently dropped the request brief from
every downstream prompt — no error, just worse answers. These tests pin the
derivation so that cannot come back.
