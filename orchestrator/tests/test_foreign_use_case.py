"""The promise, tested: a DIFFERENT use case needs no framework edit.

The claim this framework makes is narrow and worth pinning down: to build something
else, a customer writes `app/workflow.json` and puts their agent logic under
`app/subagents/<id>/`. Nothing under `app/common/`, `app/orchestrator/`,
`app/features/`, `bff/` or the IaC should need touching.

So this file builds a workflow with nothing in common with the shipped sample —
insurance claims triage, different agent ids, a different topology, a different
gate layout, its own asset type, its own contract, and NO use of the sample's shared
runners in `app/subagents/_shared/` — and asserts the framework carries it.

It exists because the framework used to fail this test in ways that were invisible
from inside the sample:

  * `rules.py` checked every payload against one editorial standard built for AWS
    research reports. `_ARTIFACT_NOUNS` contained "document", "record", "evidence"
    and "transcript", so a claims or legal workflow got its most useful sentences
    reported as defects. Deleted.
  * `AssetEnvelope` carried `ruleViolations`, a field only that engine wrote.
  * `AssetType` was an enum of the sample's five names, living in the framework.
  * The long-term-memory prompt injected into EVERY agent illustrated its point
    with "the user's background (hands-on with AWS serverless, Lambda, DynamoDB)".
  * The memory insight extractor looked for `openQuestions` / `limitations` /
    `dataLimitations` by name, so a workflow using its own words silently stored
    half of what it should.

None of that was reachable from the sample's own tests, because the sample agreed
with all of it.
