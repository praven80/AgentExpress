"""RBAC on run actions (bff/authz.py) and its two enforcement points.

The rules come from `authorization` in workflow.json, so they are config-plane.
Three things are worth pinning:

  1. the SEMANTICS — absent means unrestricted, empty means denied to everyone.
     Getting that backwards either locks everyone out of a working deployment or
     silently grants the thing you thought you had closed.
  2. the CLAIM SHAPES — the groups claim arrives as a list, a JSON string, or
     Cognito's bracketed form depending on the path. All three must normalise.
  3. the ASSISTANT — it can approve gates and re-run agents, so if it were not
     held to the same rules, "ask the chatbot" would be a way around the buttons.

`authz` reads WORKFLOW_JSON at import, so each test re-imports it with the rules
it wants.
