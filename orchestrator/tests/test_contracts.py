"""Asset contracts — strict where it matters, open where a customer needs it.

Two closed vocabularies used to silently DESTROY data: `assetType` was an enum, so
a customer's own contract could not be expressed; `sectionType` was a Literal, so
a report section the model produced but the list did not name was dropped from the
report with no error. Both are now plain `str`, with the built-in contracts still
pinning their own values. These tests hold that line in both directions.
