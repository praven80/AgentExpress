/**
 * Terraform ↔ CDK parity.
 *
 * The project promises both IaC paths deploy the same thing from the same
 * `workflow.json`. Nothing enforces that: they are two independent
 * implementations of the same projection, and they HAVE drifted — `buildBffWorkflow`
 * once emitted `mcp`/`rag` after workflow.json renamed them to `tool`/`corpus`, and
 * omitted `evalAgents` and `chatbot` entirely, so CDK deployments silently lost the
 * data-source chips, the Evaluate buttons and the in-app assistant while Terraform
 * ones kept them. Nobody noticed until a live CDK deploy was compared to a live
 * Terraform one.
 *
 * These tests read the HCL as text and compare the things a drift would show up in:
 * the key set of the BFF projection, the API route list, the tool types, the web
 * search regions, and the RBAC action list (which is duplicated in three places by
 * necessity — Terraform cannot read the Python, and TypeScript cannot read either).
 *
 * Reading HCL with regexes is crude, but the alternative is an HCL parser
 * dependency for a handful of lists, and each check below asserts it actually
 * extracted something before comparing — so a regex that stops matching fails loudly
 * rather than passing vacuously.
