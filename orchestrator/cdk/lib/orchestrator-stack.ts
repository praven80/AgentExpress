/**
 * Stage the BFF's deployment package: bff/*.py PLUS app/workflow.json, so the API
 * reads the same file the customer edits and the same file the runtime reads.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS A STAGING STEP AT ALL. `lambda.Code.fromAsset` takes one directory,
 * and the two inputs live in different ones. The alternative was what this code used
 * to do: build a trimmed PROJECTION of the workflow here in TypeScript, build the
 * same projection a second time in HCL for the Terraform path, and ship the result
 * in a `WORKFLOW_JSON` environment variable.
 *
 * Both halves of that were wrong. The two projections drifted silently — the
 * TypeScript one once emitted `mcp`/`rag` after workflow.json had renamed them to
 * `tool`/`corpus`, and omitted `evalAgents` and `chatbot` entirely, so CDK
 * deployments quietly lost the data-source chips, the Evaluate buttons and the
 * assistant. And the environment variable was a CEILING: Lambda caps the whole
 * environment at 4 KB and the quota cannot be raised, so both paths carried a
 * 3400-byte guard, the shipped ten-agent workflow measured 3153 bytes, and a
 * customer's twelfth agent failed the deploy.
 *
 * `bff/workflow.py` now does the projection once, in Python, at request time. This
 * function's only job is to put the file where that module can read it.
 *
 * Staged under cdk.out so it is a build artifact, never a mutation of the source
 * tree, and so CDK's own asset hashing sees a stable directory.
